<description><![CDATA[
The <b>keyTyped()</b> function is called once every time a key is pressed, but action keys such as Ctrl, Shift, and Alt are ignored.
<br /><br />
Because of how operating systems handle key repeats, holding down a key may cause multiple calls to <b>keyTyped()</b>. The rate of repeat is set by the operating system, and may be configured differently on each computer.
<br /><br />
Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has <b>draw()</b>. Without <b>draw()</b>, the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.
