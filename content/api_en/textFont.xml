Font support for the canvas element varies across browsers. Firefox currently has the best support, but still uses a pre-defined set of fonts. Good alternatives to the browser's canvas-font functions are available: such as the <a href="http://bocoup.com/processing-js/docs/index.php?page=Cross-Browser%20Canvas%20Fonts">Glyph method</a>. See also: <a href="http://jim.studt.net/canvastext/">Canvas Text</a>, <a href="http://canvas.burnttoys.net/bauhaus.html">BurntToys Bauhaus</a>.
<br /><br />
<p><b>Please use the following demos to learn how fonts can be rendered in Firefox with Processing.js: <a href="http://processingjs.org/learning/basic/letters">Letters</a>, <a href="http://processingjs.org/learning/basic/words">Words</a>, <a href="http://processingjs.org/source/text-width/text-width.html">width()</a></b></p>

Sets the current font that will be drawn with the <b>text()</b> function. Fonts must be created for Processing with <b>createFont()</b> or loaded with <b>loadFont()</b> before they can be used. The font set through <b>textFont()</b> will be used in all subsequent calls to the <b>text()</b> function. If no <b>size</b> parameter is input, the font will appear at its original size (the size in which it was created with the "Create Font..." tool) until it is changed with <b>textSize()</b>.<br />
<br /> Because fonts are usually bitmapped, you should create fonts at the sizes that will be used most commonly. Using <b>textFont()</b> without the size parameter will result in the cleanest type. <br />
<br />
With the default and PDF renderers, it's also possible to enable the use of native fonts via the command <b>hint(ENABLE_NATIVE_FONTS)</b>. This will produce vector text in both on-screen sketches and PDF output when the vector data is available, such as when the font is still installed, or the font is created dynamically via the <b>createFont()</b> function (rather than with the "Create Font..." tool).
