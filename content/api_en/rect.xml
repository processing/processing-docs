<description><![CDATA[
Draws a rectangle to the screen. A rectangle is a four-sided shape with every angle at ninety degrees. By default, the first two parameters set the location of the upper-left corner, the third sets the width, and the fourth sets the height. The way these parameters are interpreted, however, may be changed with the <b>rectMode()</b> function.<br />
<br />
To draw a rounded rectangle, add a fifth parameter, which is used as the radius value for all four corners.<br/>
<br/>
To use a different radius value for each corner, include eight parameters. When using eight parameters, the latter four set the radius of the arc at each corner separately, starting with the top-left corner and moving clockwise around the rectangle.
