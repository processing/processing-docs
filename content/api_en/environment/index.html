    <p>
		The <em>Processing Development Environment</em> (PDE) makes it easy to write Processing 
		programs. Programs are written in the Text Editor and started by pressing the Run button.
		In Processing, a computer program is called a <em>sketch</em>. Sketches are stored in the
		<em>Sketchbook</em>, which is a folder on your computer. It's easy to open the sketches by 
		clicking on the Open button.
    </p>

    <p>
		Sketches can draw two- and three-dimensional graphics. The default renderer is for drawing 
		two-dimensional graphics. The P3D renderer makes it possible to draw three-dimensional graphics, 
		which includes controlling the camera, lighting, and materials. 
		The P2D renderer is a fast, but last accurate renderer for drawing two-dimensional graphics. Both the P2D and P3D 
		renderers are accelerated if your computer has an OpenGL compatible graphics card.
    </p>  
       
	<p>
		The capabilities of Processing are extended with <em>Libraries</em> and <em>Tools</em>. 
		Libraries make it possible for sketches to do things beyond the <em>core</em> 
		Processing code. There are hundred of libraries contributed by the Processing community 
		that can be added to your sketches to enable new things like playing sounds, doing computer 
		vision, and working with advanced 3D geometry. Tools extend the PDE to help make creating 
		sketches easier by providing interfaces for tasks like selecting colors.
	</p>
       
    <p>
		Processing has different <em>programming modes</em> to make it possible to deploy sketches
		on different platforms and program in different ways. The current default programming modes 
		are <em>Java</em> and <em>Experimental</em>. Other programming modes, such as <em>JavaScript</em> and 
		<em>Android</em>, are added by selecting "Add Mode..." from the menu in the upper-right
		corner of the PDE. <!--The Java mode makes Java Applications, 
		the JavaScript mode makes sketches that run through HTML5 Canvas and WebGL, 
		and the Android mode makes sketches that run on Android phones and tablets.-->

    	Processing Development Environment (PDE)
    </h5>
      
    <p>
		The Processing Development Environment (PDE) consists of a simple text 
		editor for writing code, a message area, a text console, tabs for managing 
		files, a toolbar with buttons for common actions, and a series of menus. 
		The menus options change from mode to mode. The default Java mode is documented here.
	</p>
	
	<!--
	<p>
		There are three variations of the PDE, one for each programming mode. The menus
		change a little depending if it currently in Java, JavaScript, or Android mode.
		The Java and JavaScript modes are documented here. For more information about
		Android mode, please visit the <a href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/Android">Processing 
		for Android reference</a>.

    <p>
		Programs written using Processing are called sketches. These sketches are 
		written in the text editor. It has features for cutting/pasting and for 
		searching/replacing text. The message area gives feedback while saving and 
		exporting and also displays errors. The console displays text output by 
		Processing sketches including complete error messages and text output from 
		sketches with the print() and println() functions. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The buttons on the toolbar can run and stop programs, create a new sketch, open, save, 
		and export:

    <p>
    	All Processing projects are called sketches. Each sketch has its own folder. The main file 
    	for each sketch has the same name as the folder and is found inside. For example, if the 
    	sketch is named "Sketch_123", the folder for the sketch will be called "Sketch_123" and the 
    	main file will be called "Sketch_123.pde". The PDE file extension is an acronym for the 
    	Processing Development Environment.</p>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Processing sketches can be stored anywhere on your computer, but by default they are
		stored in the sketchbook, which will be in different places on your computer or network 
		depending if you use PC, Mac, or Linux and how the preferences are set. To locate this 
		folder, select the "Preferences" option from the File menu (or from the "Processing" menu 
		on the Mac) and look for the "Sketchbook location".
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A sketch folder sometimes contains other folders for media files and other code. 
		When a font or image is added to a sketch by selecting "Add File..." from the Sketch menu, 
		a "data" folder is created. Files may also be added to your Processing sketch by dragging 
		them into the text editor. Image and sound files dragged into the application window will 
		automatically be added to the current sketch's "data" folder. All images, fonts, sounds, 
		and other data files loaded in the sketch must be in this folder.

    <!-- Renderers -->

    <h5 id="Renderers">
    	<a href="#top"><img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" /></a> Renderers
    </h5>
      
    <p>
      Processing has three built-in renderers. The default renderer is for drawing two-dimensional
      shapes. <em>P2D</em> is a faster, but less accurate renderer for drawing two-dimensional 
      shapes. <em>P3D</em> is for three-dimensional geometry, it can also control
      the camera, lighting, and materials. The P2D and P3D renderers are accelerated if 
      your computer has an OpenGL compatible graphics card.
    </p>
    
    <p>  
      The renderer used for each sketch is specified through the size() function. 
      If a renderer is not explicity defined in size(), it uses the default renderer.
      For example, the following program:
    </p>
    
<pre>void setup() {
  size(200, 200);
}

void draw() {
  background(204);
  line(width/2, height/2, mouseX, mouseY);
}
</pre>

	<p>
	To change the renderer, add a third parameter to size(). For example:
	</p>

<pre>void setup() {
  size(200, 200, P2D);
}

void draw() {
  background(204);
  line(width/2, height/2, mouseX, mouseY);
}
</pre>

    <p>
      A large effort has been made to make the Processing renderers behave similarly across 
      the different renderers, but there are currently some inconsistencies that are explained 
      in the reference.
    </p>

    <!-- Coordinates -->
   
    <h5 id="Coordinates"><a href="#top"><img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Coordinates</h5>
      
    <p>
    	Processing uses a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin in the upper-left 
      	corner. If your sketch is 320 pixels wide and 240 pixels high, coordinate 
      	(0, 0) is the upper-left pixel and coordinate (320, 240) is in the lower-right. 
      	The last visible pixel in the lower-right corner of the screen is at position 
      	(319, 239) because pixels are drawn to the right and below the coordinate.
    </p>
    	
    <p>
    	<img src="images/coordinates2D3D.png" width="540" height="240" >
    </p>

    	It can be inconvenient to write a long program within a single file. 
		When Processing sketches grow to hundreds or thousands of lines, breaking them 
		into modular units helps manage the different parts. Processing manages files with 
		the Sketchbook and each sketch can have multiple files that are managed with tabs.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The arrow button to the right of the tabs in the Processing Development Environment 
		is used to manage these files. Click this button to reveal options to create a new tab, 
		rename the current tab, and delete the current tab. If a project has more than one tab, 
		they can also be hidden and revealed. Hiding a tab temporarily removes that code 
		from the sketch (it will not be compiled with the sketch when you press Run).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Tabs are intended for more advanced users, and for this reason, the menu that 
		controls the tabs is intentionally made less prominent.

		When a program with multiple tabs is run, the code is grouped together and the 
		classes in other tabs become inner classes. Because they're inner classes, they 
		cannot have static variables. Simply place the "static" variable outside the class 
		itself to do the same thing (it need not be explicitly named "static" once you list 
		it in this manner). If you don't want code to be an inner class, you can also create 
		a tab with a .java suffix, which means it will be interpreted as straight java code. 
		It is also not possible to use static classes in separate tabs. If you do this, 
		however, you'll need to pass the PApplet object to that object in that tab in order 
		to get PApplet functions like line(), loadStrings() or saveFrame() to work.<br />

    	<a href="#top"><img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" /></a> Programming Modes
    </h5>
    
    <p>
		Processing has different <em>programming modes</em> to make it possible to deploy sketches
		on different platforms and program in different ways. The current default programming modes 
		are <em>Java</em> and <em>Experimental</em>. Other programming modes, such as <em>JavaScript</em> and 
		<em>Android</em>, are added by selecting "Add Mode..." from the menu in the upper-right
		corner of the PDE. <!--The Java mode makes Java Applications, 
		the JavaScript mode makes sketches that run through HTML5 Canvas and WebGL, 
		and the Android mode makes sketches that run on Android phones and tablets.-->

    	Processing has different <em>programming modes</em> to make it possible to deploy 
    	sketches on different platforms. The three current programming modes are <em>Java</em>, 
		<em>JavaScript</em>, and <em>Android</em>. The Java mode makes Java Applications, 
		the JavaScript mode makes sketches that run through HTML5 Canvas and
		WebGL, and the Android mode makes sketches that run on Android phones and tablets. 
		Each mode has unique menu items, examples, and a distinct visual theme for the PDE.
    </p>
    -->
    
    <!--
    <p>
    	While each mode has some custom language elements, the core Processing syntax works 
    	identically regardless of the mode and export platform. Additionally, now that the 
    	software architecture for modes is in place, it's possible to create many other
    	compatible modes based on other programming and scripting languages such as Python, 
    	and Ruby, etc.
    </p>
    -->
      
      
    <h6>Java Mode</h6>
    
    <p>
    	This mode makes it possible to write short programs to draw to the screen, but also
    	enables complex Java programs as well. It's can be used simply by beginners, but 
    	it scales to professional Java software development. Sketches written in this mode can
    	be exported as Java Applications to run on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows operating 
    	systems. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
		<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="20" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">
  			<tr>
  				<td>
		<em>Advanced</em><br />
		<br />
		Java files with the extension .java can be included with a Java mode sketch. 
		They may be created directly in the PDE or copied into the sketch folder through 
		the "Add File..." item in the Sketch menu or dragged into the text editor. It's possible 
		to write any Java code in files with the .java extension. In fact, complete Java code 
		can be written from inside the Processing Environment by subclassing PApplet like this:
   	
   	<pre>

public class MyDemo extends PApplet {
   	</pre>
   	
   		This is for advanced developers only and is not really recommended. Using this technique 
   		means that any additional tabs will no longer be inner classes, meaning you'll have to 
   		do extra work to make them communicate properly with the host PApplet. It is not necessary 
   		to use this technique just to get features of the Java language. Advanced developers can
   		also program with Processing in another Java Editor if higher-level code editing and
   		tools are needed. We've documented how to use 
   		<a href="http://processing.org/learning/eclipse/">Processing
   		in Eclipse</a>, but core.jar can be used as a part of any Java project.

    <!--
    <h6>JavaScript Mode</h6>
    
    <p>
    	The JavaScript Mode is built around <a href="http://processingjs.org">Processing.js</a>, 
    	a port of the Processing API to JavaScript that renders with HTML5 Canvas and WebGL.
    	Processing.js was originally started by John Resig and is now developed by a great team 
    	at Seneca College led by David Humphrey.
    </p>
    	
    <p>
    	This mode allows Processing to export Processing.js sketches directly from inside the
    	Processing environment to target web environments without having to worry about plugins. 
    	Running a sketch starts a server that delivers the code directly from its export 
    	folder. This allows you to view and test your sketch on multiple browsers and even 
    	multiple devices if you are on a network. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	When the Run button is pressed, a new local server is started and the default web 
    	browser opens a new window with the address of the server. To make changes
    	to the code, navigate back to Processing and make the changes in the text editor. Save
    	the sketch, then navigate back to the web browser and reload the page. Press "stop" or 
    	close the sketch window will stop the server. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	If the computer is on a network the sketch can be accessed by other devices on the 
    	network through the IP address of the computer followd by the port assigned by Processing. 
    	Just replace "127.0.0.1" with your computer's IP address. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	Similar to .java tabs in the Java mode, JavaScript files may be added to 
    	a sketch. Create a new tab with a name ending in ".js" or drag an existing ".js" file 
    	into the text editor of the sketch to copy it. JavaScript tabs make it possible to
    	write pure JavaScript code inside the PDE that can reach beyond what the Processing 
    	language alone offers. Check the examples included with the mode to see how to 
    	integrate JavaScript code. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	JavaScript Mode is new for Processing 2.0. There's more information about this mode
    	on the emerging <a href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/JavaScript">JavaScript Mode</a> 
    	page on the Processing Wiki.
    </p>-->
    
    <h6>JavaScript Mode</h6>

		Sketches written in this mode can be exported to run inside web browsers using
		HTML5 and WebGL. This mode is documented on the <a href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/JavaScript">
		JavaScript</a> page of the Processing Wiki.

    <h5 id="Programming_modes">
    	<a href="#top"><img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" /></a> Programming Modes
    </h5>
    
    <p>Processing allows people to create sketches at three levels of complexity: Basic 
      Mode, Continuous Mode, and Java Mode. People new to programming should begin 
      with the Basic Mode to learn about coordinates, variables, and loops before 
      moving to Continuous and Java modes. </p>
      
      
    <h6>Basic</h6>
    <p>This mode is used drawing static images and learning fundamentals of programming. 
      Simple lines of code have a direct representation on the screen. The following 
      example draws a yellow rectangle on the screen:</p>
    <pre>size(200, 200);
background(255);
noStroke();
fill(255, 204, 0);
rect(30, 20, 50, 50);
</pre>


    <h6>Continuous</h6>
    <p>This mode provides a setup() structure that is run once when the sketch 
      begins and a draw() structure which by default continually loops through 
      the code inside. This additional structure allows writing custom functions 
      and classes and using keyboard and mouse events.<br>
      <br>
      This example draws four circles on the screen and utilizes a custom function 
      called circles(). The circles() function is not a part of the Processing 
      language, but was written for this example. The code in draw() only runs 
      once because noLoop() is called in setup().</p>
    <pre>void setup() {
  size(200, 200);
  noStroke();
  background(255);
  fill(0, 102, 153, 204);
  smooth();
  noLoop();
}

void draw() {
  circles(40, 80);
  circles(90, 70);
}

void circles(int x, int y) {
  ellipse(x, y, 50, 50);
  ellipse(x+20, y+20, 60, 60);
}</pre>
    <p>This example draws rectangles that follow the mouse position (stored in 
      the system variables mouseX and mouseY). The <b>draw()</b> 
      block runs forever until the sketch is stopped, thus creating the 
      potential for motion and interaction.</p>
    <pre>void setup() {
  size(200, 200);
  rectMode(CENTER);
  noStroke();
  fill(0, 102, 153, 204);
}

void draw() {
  background(255);
  rect(width-mouseX, height-mouseY, 50, 50);
  rect(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50);
}
</pre>


    <h6>Java</h6>
    <p>
    	This mode is the most flexible, allowing complete Java code to be written from inside 
    	the Processing Environment (as long as they're still subclasses of PApplet). This mode 
    	is for advanced users only and is not really recommended. Using this mode means that any 
    	additional tabs will no longer be inner classes, meaning that you'll have to do extra 
    	work to make them communicate properly with the host PApplet. It is not necessary to use 
    	this mode just to get features of the Java language.
    </p>

    <pre>public class MyDemo extends PApplet {

  void setup() {
    size(200, 200);

    rectMode(CENTER);
    noStroke();
    fill(0, 102, 153, 204);
  }

  void draw() {
    background(255);
    rect(width-mouseX, height-mouseY, 50, 50);
    rect(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50);
  }
}
</pre>

    <!-- more for JAVA
    
	<p>
		It is possible to have multiple files in a single sketch. These can be Processing text 
		files (the extension .pde) or Java files (the extension .java). To create a new file, 
		click on the arrow button to the right of the file tabs. This button gives access to 
		creating, deleting, and renaming the files that comprise the current sketch. You can 
		write functions and classes in new PDE files and you can write any Java code in files 
		with the JAVA extension. Working with multiple files makes it easier to re-use code 
		and to separate sketches into small sub-programs.
