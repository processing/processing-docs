Writes to the console area of the Processing environment. This is often helpful for looking at the data a program is producing. The companion function <b>println()</b> works like <b>print()</b>, but creates a new line of text for each call to the function. Individual elements can be separated with quotes ("") and joined with the addition operator (+).<br />
<br />
Beginning with release 0125, to print the contents of an array, use println(). There's no sensible way to do a <b>print()</b> of an array, 
because there are too many possibilities for how to separate the data (spaces, commas, etc). If you want to print an array as a single line, use <b>join()</b>. With <b>join()</b>, you can choose any delimiter you like and <b>print()</b> the result.<br />
<br />
Using <b>print()</b> on an object will output <b>null</b>, a memory location that may look like "@10be08," or the result of the <b>toString()</b> method from the object that's being printed. Advanced users who want more useful output when calling <b>print()</b> on their own classes can add a <b>toString()</b> method to the class that returns a String.
