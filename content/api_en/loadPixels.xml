<description><![CDATA[
Loads a snapshot of the current display window into the <b>pixels[]</b> array. This function must always be called before reading from or writing to <b>pixels[]</b>. Subsequent changes to the display window will not be reflected in <b>pixels</b> until <b>loadPixels()</b> is called again.<br />
<br />
Certain renderers may or may not seem to require <b>loadPixels()</b> or <b>updatePixels()</b>. However, the rule is that any time you want to manipulate the <b>pixels[]</b> array, you must have previously called <b>loadPixels()</b>, and after changes have been made, call <b>updatePixels()</b>. Even if the renderer may not seem to use this function in the current Processing release, this will always be subject to change.
