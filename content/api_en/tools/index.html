	<i>The following tools are included with the Processing software. Select the tool you want 
	to use from the Tools menu of the Processing Environment. These tools are open source; the 
	code is distributed with Processing.</i>
</p>

<div class="threecol">

    <h5>Color Selector</h5>
    <p>Simple interface for selecting colors as RGB, HSB, and Hex values.</p>
          
    <h5>Archive Sketch</h5>
    <p>Archives a copy of the current sketch in .zip format. The archive is placed in 
    the same directory as the sketch.</p>

</div>

<div class="threecol">

    <h5>Movie Maker</h5>
    <p>Creates a QuickTime movie from a sequence of images. Options include setting the 
    size, frame rate, and compression, as well as an audio file.</p>

    <h5>Create Font</h5>
    <p>Converts fonts into the Processing font format and adds to the current sketch. 
      Opens a dialog box which give options for setting the font, its size, if 
      it is anti-aliased, and if all characters should be generated.</p>

</div>

<div class="threecol">
    
    <h5>Fix Encoding &amp; Reload</h5>
    <p>Sketches that contain non-ASCII characters and were saved with Processing 0140 
    and earlier may look strange when opened. Garbled text and odd characters may appear
    where umlauts, cedillas, and Japanese formerly lived. This will reload your sketch 
    using the same method as previous versions of Processing, at which point you can 
    re-save it which will write a proper UTF-8 version.</p>
