<description><![CDATA[
Writes an array of Strings to a file, one line per String. By default, this file is saved to the sketch's folder. This folder is opened by selecting "Show Sketch Folder" from the "Sketch" menu.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, the file can be saved to any location on the computer by using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and Linux, or a drive letter on Windows).<br />
<br />
Starting with Processing 1.0, all files loaded and saved by the Processing API use UTF-8 encoding. In earlier releases, the default encoding for your platform was used, which causes problems when files are moved to other platforms.
