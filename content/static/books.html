			  This book is an introduction to the ideas of computer programming within the context of the visual arts. It targets an audience of computer-savvy individuals who are interested in creating interactive and visual work through writing software but have little or no prior experience. It is the result of six years of software development and teaching experience. The ideas presented have been continually tested in the classrooms, computer labs, basements of universities, art and design schools, and arts institutions.<br />
			  <br />
			  The majority of the book is divided into tutorial units discussing specific elements of software and how they relate to the arts. These units introduce the syntax and concepts of software such as variables, functions, and object-oriented programming. They cover topics such as photography and drawing in relation to software. These units feature many short, prototypical example programs with related images and explanation. More advanced professional projects from diverse domains including 
				animation, performance, and typography are discussed in interviews with their creators. The extension sections present concise introductions to further domains of exploration including computer vision, sound, and electronics.<br />
			  <br />
			  Essays by Alexander R. Galloway, Golan Levin, R. Luke DuBois, Simon Greenwold, Francis Li, and Hernando Barragan.<br />
			  <br />
			  Interviews with Jared Tarbell, Martin Wattenberg, James Paterson, Erik van Blockland, Ed Burton, Josh On, Jeurg Lehni, Auriea Harvey and Michael Samyn, Mathew Cullen and Grady Hall, Bob Sabiston, Jennifer Steinkamp, Ruth Jarman and Joseph Gerhardt, Sue Costabile, Chris Csikszentmihalyi, Golan Levin and Zachary Lieberman, and Mark Hansen.<br />

			The O'Reilly website says, &quot;How you can take advantage of data that you might otherwise never use? With the help of a powerful new programming environment [Processing], this book helps you represent data accurately on the Web and elsewhere, complete with user interaction, animation, and more. You'll learn basic visualization principles, how to choose the right kind of display for your purposes, and how to provide interactive features to design entire interfaces around large, complex data sets.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			Martin Wattenberg from the IBM Watson Research Center says, &quot;This wonderfully detailed guide, by one of the masters of modern data graphics, tells you everything you need to know to code your own visualizations from scratch. Perhaps most valuable are the many examples where Fry demonstrates how to refine a bare-bones concept into a beautiful, effective finished piece. Read this book, and you'll never again be dependent on someone else's view of your data.&quot;<br />

		This book is extraordinary; the design is clear and the production quality is fantastic. This is the design book about Processing that we've hoped for. Unlike most other Processing books, it doesn't discuss programming basics so it's free to start with exciting examples. The publisher promotes, &quot;Generative design is a revolutionary new method of creating artwork, models, and animations from sets of rules, or algorithms. By using accessible programming languages such as Processing, artists and designers are producing extravagant, crystalline structures that can form the basis of anything from patterned textiles and typography to lighting, scientific diagrams, sculptures, films, and even fantastical buildings. Opening with a gallery of thirty-five illustrated case studies, <em>Generative Design</em> takes users through specific, practical instructions on how to create their own visual experiments by combining simple-to-use programming codes with basic design principles. A detailed handbook of advanced strategies provides visual artists with all the tools to achieve proficiency. Both a how-to manual and a showcase for recent work in this exciting new field, <em>Generative Design</em> is the definitive study and reference book that designers have been waiting for.&quot;<br />

			<br />
			The book description reads, &quot;Learn how to create gorgeous and expressive imagery with the Processing programming language and environment... Walk with veteran author Andrew Glassner on a journey of shared discovery as he takes actual Processing projects from inspiration to reality. You'll closely follow every step he takes and see exactly how each project evolves, including big and small mistakes he's made along the way (and how to fix them!), and the times when he changed direction. Once you see the results, you'll understand why programming is such a powerful skill for self-expression.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			This book has a different perspective from the others because of Glassner's deep experience in computer graphics. His bio reads, &quot;Dr. Andrew Glassner is a writer-director, and a consultant in story structure, interactive fiction, and computer graphics. He started working in 3D computer graphics in 1978, and has carried out research at the NYIT Computer Graphics Lab, Case Western Reserve University, the IBM TJ Watson Research Lab, the Delft University of Technology, Bell Communications Research, Xerox PARC, and Microsoft Research... He is also a well-known writer, and has published numerous technical papers and books on topics ranging from 3D modeling, rendering, and animation to digital sound synthesis. His book '3D Computer Graphics: A Handbook for Artists and Designers' has taught a generation of artists through two editions and three languages. Glassner created and edited the 'Graphics Gems' series and created and wrote several chapters in the book 'An Introduction to Ray Tracing'. He wrote the two-volume text 'Principles of Digital Image Synthesis'.&quot;</td>

		Ira tells us, &quot;The Essential Guide to Processing for Flash Developers takes a focused, hands-on approach to learning Processing that builds upon your familiarity with Flash, and experience with ActionScript and object-oriented programming concepts. The first three chapters are designed as a language primer explaining all the Processing specific programming theory you'll need to know, with numerous code examples. The rest of the book is project based, including a character animation; particle engine; serious game, with AI; cellular automata framework, including a .lif file format parser and a 3D data visualization. Each project is structured to allow less experienced coders to get up to speed relatively quickly, while leaving room for more experienced programmers to take the initial project concepts and run with them—building more complex applications. The last chapter introduces Processing’s Java mode, providing an easy to navigate bridge to programming in Java, Processing’s underlying host language.&quot;

		The OReilly.de site writes, &quot;Processing ist eine auf Grafik, Simulation und Animation spezialisierte objektorientierte Programmiersprache, die besonders für Menschen mit wenig Programmiererfahrung geeignet ist. Deshalb eignet sie sich vor allem für Künstler, Bastler und Programmiereinsteiger. Die aus Java abgeleitete Sprache wurde geschaffen, um schnell und effektiv mit relativ wenig Aufwand zu beeindruckenden Ergebnissen zu kommen. Processing führt den Leser zügig in die Programmieressentials ein und geht dann unmittelbar zur Programmierung grafisch anspruchsvoller Anwendungen über. Spielerisch wird dem Leser die 2D- und 3D-Programierung, Textrendering, die Bildbearbeitung und sogar die Videomanipulation nahe gebracht.&quot;

            The publisher says, &quot;Décuplez votre créativité avec Processing ! Créé par des artistes pour des artistes dans un esprit de simplicité et de cohérence, Processing est un couteau-suisse mulltimédia qui permet de réaliser par programmation toutes sortes d'applications dans les domaines du design graphique, de l'image animée, du son, de la 3D ou de la communication interactive. Avec Processing, le code informatique devient un matériau des arts plastiques au même titre que l'argile, le fusain ou l'aquarelle. Ce livre vous aidera à prendre en main le logiciel et à concevoir vos premières créations. Il aborde les différents aspects du langage, depuis l'installation du logiciel jusqu'à la fabrication de documents pdf et de vidéos ou le traitement dynamique de données XML et le pilotage d'appareils électroniques tels que les cartes de prototypage Arduino et Wiring. Tirant parti de leur expérience pédagogique dans le domaine, les auteurs ont voulu que leur livre soit à la fois une référence complète sur le langage Processing et un cours progressif accessible aux lecteurs débutants en programmation.&quot;

			Note from Casey: &quot;I received a copy of this book from the authors on a recent trip to Japan. It's a beautifully produced full-color book with sections introducing Processing, featuring work created with Processing (many are from the Exhibition section of the Processing website), and introducing programming through progressively complicated examples. The majority of the book is an introduction to programming. There are many good examples and the code is color-coded like in the Processing Environment. This book is less comprehensive than the Greenberg and Reas/Fry books, but it appears to be a good, brief introduction.&quot;<br />
