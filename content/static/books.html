			  The second edition of the Handbook has been thoroughly updated, influenced by the seven years of Processing being taught in classrooms, computer labs, and studios since the first edition. Every chapter has been revised, and added chapters introduce new ways to work with data and geometry. New “synthesis” chapters offer discussion and worked examples of such topics as sketching with code, modularity, and algorithms. Interviews have been added that cover a wider range of projects and history. “Extension” chapters are now offered online so they can be updated to keep pace with technological developments in such fields as computer vision and electronics.

			The authors write, "Finally, a book on creative programming, written directly for artists and designers! Rather than following a computer science curriculum, this book is aimed at creatives who are working in the intersection of design, art, and education. In this book you'll learn to apply computation into the creative process by following a four-step process, and through this, land in the cross section of coding and art, with a focus on practical examples and relevant work structures. You'll follow a real-world use case of computation art and see how it relates back to the four key pillars, and addresses potential pitfalls and challenges in the creative process. All code examples are presented in a fully integrated Processing example library, making it easy for readers to get started."

			The Publisher writes, &quot;Understand the importance of programming, even if you’ve never programmed before! This book will teach you the basics of programming using the Processing programming language. You will create your own Processing sketches, using personal images, themes, or hobbies that you enjoy. The chapters in the book will demonstrate the process of programming, starting with formulating an idea, planning, building on past projects, and refining the work, similar to writing an essay or composing a song. This approach will guide you to make use of logic and mathematics to produce beautiful effects. The term for program in Processing is sketch, though the sketches featured in this book are far more than static drawings; they incorporate interaction, animation, video, audio, and accessing files on the local computer and on the Web. Technical features are introduced and explained in the context of complete examples: games (Snake, Hangman, jigsaw, slingshot), making a collage of family images and video clips, preparing directions for folding an origami model, rotating objects in 3D, and others.&quot;

			The O'Reilly website says, &quot;How you can take advantage of data that you might otherwise never use? With the help of a powerful new programming environment [Processing], this book helps you represent data accurately on the Web and elsewhere, complete with user interaction, animation, and more. You'll learn basic visualization principles, how to choose the right kind of display for your purposes, and how to provide interactive features to design entire interfaces around large, complex data sets.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			Martin Wattenberg from the IBM Watson Research Center says, &quot;This wonderfully detailed guide, by one of the masters of modern data graphics, tells you everything you need to know to code your own visualizations from scratch. Perhaps most valuable are the many examples where Fry demonstrates how to refine a bare-bones concept into a beautiful, effective finished piece. Read this book, and you'll never again be dependent on someone else's view of your data.&quot;<br />

		This book is extraordinary; the design is clear and the production quality is fantastic. This is the design book about Processing that we've hoped for. Unlike most other Processing books, it doesn't discuss programming basics so it's free to start with exciting examples. The publisher promotes, &quot;Generative design is a revolutionary new method of creating artwork, models, and animations from sets of rules, or algorithms. By using accessible programming languages such as Processing, artists and designers are producing extravagant, crystalline structures that can form the basis of anything from patterned textiles and typography to lighting, scientific diagrams, sculptures, films, and even fantastical buildings. Opening with a gallery of thirty-five illustrated case studies, <em>Generative Design</em> takes users through specific, practical instructions on how to create their own visual experiments by combining simple-to-use programming codes with basic design principles. A detailed handbook of advanced strategies provides visual artists with all the tools to achieve proficiency. Both a how-to manual and a showcase for recent work in this exciting new field, <em>Generative Design</em> is the definitive study and reference book that designers have been waiting for.&quot;<br />

Once you see the results, you'll understand why programming is such a powerful skill for self-expression.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			This book has a different perspective from the others because of Glassner's deep experience in computer graphics. His bio reads, &quot;Dr. Andrew Glassner is a writer-director, and a consultant in story structure, interactive fiction, and computer graphics. He started working in 3D computer graphics in 1978, and has carried out research at the NYIT Computer Graphics Lab, Case Western Reserve University, the IBM TJ Watson Research Lab, the Delft University of Technology, Bell Communications Research, Xerox PARC, and Microsoft Research... He is also a well-known writer, and has published numerous technical papers and books on topics ranging from 3D modeling, rendering, and animation to digital sound synthesis. His book '3D Computer Graphics: A Handbook for Artists and Designers' has taught a generation of artists through two editions and three languages. Glassner created and edited the 'Graphics Gems' series and created and wrote several chapters in the book 'An Introduction to Ray Tracing'. He wrote the two-volume text 'Principles of Digital Image Synthesis'.&quot;</td>

		The Friends of Ed website says, &quot;This book is written especially for artists, designers, and other creative professionals and students exploring code art, graphics programming, and computational aesthetics. The book provides a solid and comprehensive foundation in programming, including object-oriented principles, and introduces you to the easy-to-grasp Processing language, so no previous coding experience is necessary. The book then goes through using Processing to code lines, curves, shapes, and motion, continuing to the point where you'll have mastered Processing and can really start to unleash your creativity with realistic physics, interactivity, and 3D! In the final chapter, you'll even learn how to extend your Processing skills by working directly with the powerful Java programming language, the language Processing itself is built with.&quot; (Quote from the Friends of Ed website)<br />

		Ira tells us, &quot;The Essential Guide to Processing for Flash Developers takes a focused, hands-on approach to learning Processing that builds upon your familiarity with Flash, and experience with ActionScript and object-oriented programming concepts. The first three chapters are designed as a language primer explaining all the Processing specific programming theory you'll need to know, with numerous code examples. The rest of the book is project based, including a character animation; particle engine; serious game, with AI; cellular automata framework, including a .lif file format parser and a 3D data visualization. Each project is structured to allow less experienced coders to get up to speed relatively quickly, while leaving room for more experienced programmers to take the initial project concepts and run with them—building more complex applications. The last chapter introduces Processing’s Java mode, providing an easy to navigate bridge to programming in Java, Processing’s underlying host language.&quot;

          <p>Die eigenst&auml;ndige Programmiersprache Processing basiert auf Java und &auml;hnelt diesem sehr, verbirgt aber gleichzeitig viel von dessen Komplexit&auml;t. Dadurch ist Processing f&uuml;r den Programmieranf&auml;nger ideal geeignet, um sich Konzepte des Programmierens zu erschlie&szlig;en und bewahrt gleichzeitig die M&ouml;glichkeit eines sp&auml;teren Umstiegs. Dennoch ist die Sprache keineswegs nur f&uuml;r triviale Anf&auml;ngeraufgaben geeignet: speziell im Bereich der graphischen Datenverarbeitung spielt Processing seine St&auml;rken aus.</p>
          <p>Dieses Buch richtet sich in erster Linie an den Einsteiger, den es an die Bew&auml;ltigung auch komplexerer Aufgaben heranf&uuml;hrt, wobei grundlegende Konzepte der imperativen und der objektorientierten Programmierung vorgestellt werden. Auch notwendige theoretische Hintergr&uuml;nde kommen dabei nicht zu kurz. Ausf&uuml;hrlich kommentierter Beispielcode erschlie&szlig;t Konzepte und Sprache. Aber auch der routinierte Programmierer, der sich "nur" eine neue Sprache erschlie&szlig;en will, wird f&uuml;ndig!<p />

		The OReilly.de site writes, &quot;Processing ist eine auf Grafik, Simulation und Animation spezialisierte objektorientierte Programmiersprache, die besonders für Menschen mit wenig Programmiererfahrung geeignet ist. Deshalb eignet sie sich vor allem für Künstler, Bastler und Programmiereinsteiger. Die aus Java abgeleitete Sprache wurde geschaffen, um schnell und effektiv mit relativ wenig Aufwand zu beeindruckenden Ergebnissen zu kommen. Processing führt den Leser zügig in die Programmieressentials ein und geht dann unmittelbar zur Programmierung grafisch anspruchsvoller Anwendungen über. Spielerisch wird dem Leser die 2D- und 3D-Programierung, Textrendering, die Bildbearbeitung und sogar die Videomanipulation nahe gebracht.&quot;

            The publisher says, &quot;Décuplez votre créativité avec Processing ! Créé par des artistes pour des artistes dans un esprit de simplicité et de cohérence, Processing est un couteau-suisse mulltimédia qui permet de réaliser par programmation toutes sortes d'applications dans les domaines du design graphique, de l'image animée, du son, de la 3D ou de la communication interactive. Avec Processing, le code informatique devient un matériau des arts plastiques au même titre que l'argile, le fusain ou l'aquarelle. Ce livre vous aidera à prendre en main le logiciel et à concevoir vos premières créations. Il aborde les différents aspects du langage, depuis l'installation du logiciel jusqu'à la fabrication de documents pdf et de vidéos ou le traitement dynamique de données XML et le pilotage d'appareils électroniques tels que les cartes de prototypage Arduino et Wiring. Tirant parti de leur expérience pédagogique dans le domaine, les auteurs ont voulu que leur livre soit à la fois une référence complète sur le langage Processing et un cours progressif accessible aux lecteurs débutants en programmation.&quot;

			<strong>Il Codice dei Cibernetici: Introduzione alla Computer Art con Processing</strong><br />
			Antonio Rollo<br />
			Published December 2015, Oistros Edizioni. 320 pages. Softcover.<br />
			Text in Italian.<br />
			<br />
			During the 50&lsquo;s &rdquo;era of cybernetics&ldquo;, computer entered into the history of art simultaneously in different parts of the world. Art and science were in great turmoil. Science, with its theories and experiments, was approaching artificially mimicking both natural phenomena, such as light and sound, and the human phenomena of language and communication. Art, with its aesthetic and exhibitions, had transcended the boundaries of the avant-garde. Now, with the computer, it was confronting a reality that challenged &rdquo;the where&ldquo; and &rdquo;the how&ldquo; of doing art and the very meaning of &rdquo;masterpiece&ldquo;. Antonio Rollo takes us on a tour of these seminal works from his unique perspective of the artist, through the code!

			<br />
			Note from Casey: &quot;I received a copy of this book from the authors on a recent trip to Japan. It's a beautifully produced full-color book with sections introducing Processing, featuring work created with Processing (many are from the Exhibition section of the Processing website), and introducing programming through progressively complicated examples. The majority of the book is an introduction to programming. There are many good examples and the code is color-coded like in the Processing Environment. This book is less comprehensive than the Greenberg and Reas/Fry books, but it appears to be a good, brief introduction.&quot;<br />

			<strong>Programming for Artists</strong><br />

			The author's website reads, &quot;Летом 2015 года мне удалось подготовить к выходу в свет новую книгу, посвященную программированию для художников и дизайнеров. Книга рассматривает среду Processing как одну из самых простых и доступных в освоении. Я акцентировал внимание на том, что каждый человек, знакомый с азами математики, может научиться использовать программирование для своих творческих задач. Конечно, я говорю про активных дизайнеров, которые не боятся использовать и изучать новые для себя инструменты.<br />
			<br />
			Часто я слышу вопросы: “Зачем художнику нужно программировать? Почему нельзя просто взять и нарисовать от руки? А что, фотошоп отменили? Неужели у художников есть математическая логика?” Мне эти вопросы кажутся замечательными и напоминают художника в момент появления фотографии, когда художники спорили с фотографами примерно теми же словами, разве что слова фотошоп еще не было. И сейчас у нас развивается искусство фотографии бурным потоком. Более развернутый ответ вы можете найти во вступительной статье.<br />
			<br />
			Итак, представляю вашему вниманию книгу “Программирование для дизайнеров”. Книга вышла на русском языке при поддержке Европейского Союза, организации Темпус по проекту 544083 “Enhancement of Russian creative education: new Master program in Digital Arts in line with EU standards [ENMDA]”. Ее можно найти в библиотеках страны и несколько копий будет находиться в библиотеке политехнического университета. Выражаю благодарность кафедре инженерной графики и дизайна за помощь в издании, некоторые страницы печатного издания цветные, что приятно.&quot;
